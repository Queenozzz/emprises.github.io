                        <p>
                            The U.S. is a country of 50 states covering a vast swath of North America, with Alaska in the
                            northwest and Hawaii
                            extending the nationâ€™s presence into the Pacific Ocean. Major Atlantic Coast cities are New York, a
                            global finance and
                            culture center, and capital Washington, DC. Midwestern metropolis Chicago is known for influential
                            architecture and on
                            the west coast, Los Angeles' Hollywood is famed for filmmaking.

                            the glamour that it
                            brings, the 'Golden State' of California really does shine bright; it may be the most diverse state
                            in the US for all
                            that it has to offer.

                            as are the Florida Keys - an incredible chain of islands that stretch down into the Caribbean.

                        <p>
                            Due to its colossal size, distinctive identity, and rich cultural heritage, Texas is an exciting
                            part of the States to
                            explore. <br>
                            Many people in the state would claim to be Texan before being American, as there is a very
                            independent spirit
                            about the place.
                            <br> <br>
                            Known for their larger-than-life exuberance and generosity, the Texan population is very welcoming
                            and friendly; this
                            is, in part, what makes visiting cities such as Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio such a memorable
                            experience, in
                            addition to all of the beautiful sights.
                            <br> <br>
                            Because of its vast landmass, Texas is home to a diverse array of landscapes, with great plains and
                            plateaus lying
                            alongside rolling hills, rivers, and pine forests, while beautiful mountains, deserts, and canyons
                            can be found in Big
                            Bend National Park.

                            Breathtakingly beautiful beaches and the rocky cliffs of Big Sur line its Pacific coastline, while
                            the rugged Sierra
                            Nevada mountains and arid desert of Death Valley mark its interior. <br>
                            California boasts a stunning array of different
                            landscapes, with lots of amazing national parks, such as Joshua Tree, Redwood, and Yosemite.
                            Consequently, there are
                            loads of great outdoor activities, with mountain biking, hiking, and camping all popular.
                            <br> <br>
                            While no visit to California can be complete without stopping by Hollywood in Los Angeles or the
                            Golden Gate Bridge and
                            Alcatraz in San Francisco, the cities of Santa Barbara and San Diego are also well worth visiting.
                            <br>
                            Don't forget the Napa
                            Valley, which is home to fertile vineyards and wineries that produce some of the most famous wines

                            The largest state in the country, Alaska really is a world unto itself. Its vast and endless
                            forests, frozen tundra, and
                            mountain ranges are separated from the mainland USA by Canada.
                            <br> <br>
                            Due to its remote wilderness, Alaska is a challenging yet rewarding place to explore. It is not
                            without reason that the
                            sparsely inhabited state has been nicknamed 'the Last Frontier'. <br>
                            Indeed, much of the region is located in the Arctic, so
                            features breathtakingly beautiful glaciers, lakes, and volcanoes. <br> <br>
                            Abundant wildlife, such as brown bears, wolves, and
                            moose, can be found in spectacular places like Glacier Bay National Park and Denali National Park,
                            which boasts the
                            highest peak in North America.
                            <br> <br>
                            With so many unbelievable natural sights, Alaska is ideal for adventurers and nature lovers who want
                            to immerse
                            themselves in its stunning scenery, with hiking, kayaking, and fishing all very popular.
                            <br>
                            The cities of Anchorage and Homer both act as gateways to the magnificent wilderness that Alaska has
                            to offer up, and
                            many people come to witness the spectacular Northern Lights.

                            Located some 3,700 kilometers off California in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the volcanic
                            archipelago of Hawaii has
                            long astounded visitors with its natural beauty, and it is not surprising that it's a top-rated
                            holiday destination.
                            <br> <br>
                            While each of the islands has its own unique features and attractions, they are all blessed with
                            magnificent mountain
                            scenery, and lots of pristine beaches dot their scenic shorelines. <br> <br>
                            Some of the most majestic sights
                            on show are the
                            NaPali Coast and Waimea Canyon on Kaua'i, and Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on Big Island, while
                            Waikiki Beach on Oahu
                            is one of the region's most famous destinations.

                        <p>
                            With the Gulf of Mexico to one side of it and the Atlantic Ocean to the other, it should come as no
                            surprise to learn
                            that much of Florida's peninsula is lined with beautiful beaches and scenic coastline, which have
                            helped earn it the
                            nickname of 'the Sunshine State.
                            <br> <br>
                            Due to its warm and inviting climate, sparkling waters, and an abundance of world-class theme parks
                            and thriving seaside
                            cities, Florida is a top-rated holiday destination. Fort Lauderdale, Miami, and Orlando attract
                            hordes of visitors, who
                            come to enjoy all they have to offer.
                            <br> <br>
                            Away from its resorts and white sandy beaches, Florida is awash with stunning nature; both Biscayne
                            and Everglades National Park are well worth checking out, as are the Florida Keys - an incredible
                            chain of islands
                            that stretch down into the Caribbean.

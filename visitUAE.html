                            The UAE is a Muslim country. Virtually all citizens practice Islam. If you've never been to a Muslim
                            country before,
                            make sure you brush up on the etiquette. It's important to think about how you dress and how you
                            behave in public.
                            <br> <br>
                            The best place to learn more about Islam is at the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque.

                            The Global Village is a theme park of sorts, and it's one of the best places to visit at
                            night. At the Global Village, you can explore a multitude of cultures and shop for unique regional
                            products.

                            In general, modest dress is strongly recommended-especially in public spaces. Be sure to cover up
                            from your shoulders
                            to your knees, and avoid anything transparent or tightly fitted. You should also limit any public
                            displays of affection.

                            The Muslim faith is tightly woven with UAE culture, so to learn more about the latter, it's
                            important to try and
                            understand the dominant religion.

                            The best place to learn more about Islam is at the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque. Located close to the
                            waterfront close to
                            some of the city's flashiest hotels including the Rixos Marina Abu Dhabi, this is Abu Dhabi's most
                            famous tourist
                            attraction -and for good reason. You've never seen a mosque quite like this one.

                        <p>
                            Dubai is a city of immigrants. Almost 80% of people living in the UAE are not citizens. The reason
                            for this is that
                            Dubai has very open borders. It's become a melting pot of sorts.
                            <br> <br>
                            Dubai isn't just an excellent place to eat authentic Emirati food-you'll also find authentic
                            Chinese, Lebanese and
                            Japanese food, too.
                            <br> <br>
                            Dubai's global population hasn't just influenced the city's food scene, it's also inspired one of
                            the city's most
                            popular cultural attractions.
                            <br> <br>
                            The Global Village is a theme park of sorts, and it's one of the best places to visit at

                            Each country has its own shopping experience and you can get authentic spices, perfumes and
                            textiles. It's a great place
                            to meet people, ask questions, try food and buy souvenirs.

                            Dubai Creek:the views of the sparkly turquoise water
                        </h4> <br> <br>
                        <p>
                            The Dubai Creek has been one of the most important economic routes throughout the history of the
                            UAE, helping the
                            emirates to grow and flourish. It's on UNESCO's tentative list of Heritage Sites because of its
                            cultural and social
                            importance.
                            <br> <br>
                            There is evidence to suggest that Dubai Creek was the site of a pearling industry as early as the
                            16th century. By the
                            19th century, it became well-established in British documents as a trading post. Throughout the
                            succeeding years, this
                            was an important site for fishing, pearling and general trade.
                            <br> <br>
                            In the early days, the Emirati people used an abra to cross the creek. An abra is a small
                            traditional wooden boat
                            powered by oars.
                            <br> <br>
                            One of the most immersive ways to step back in time is by riding a traditional abra across Dubai
                            Creek. Todaybrs version
                            is equipped with a diesel engine, but you get the picture!
                            <br> <br>
                            This is a very quick and cheap activity to enjoy in Dubai, but the views of the sparkly turquoise
                            water are
                            unforgettable. There are lots of other fun tourist activities to enjoy in the area.

                        <p>
                            A souk is a traditional open-air marketplace. This is historically where locals came to trade and
                            buy essential goods.
                            <br> <br>
                            Dubai's most famous souks are located near the Dubai Creek. There's a Spice Souk and a Gold Souk-but
                            you'll find many
                            things here besides just spices and gold! Textiles, perfumes, rugs, clothes and pipes are just some
                            of the handcrafted
                            trinkets on offer.
                            <br> <br>
                            This is a great place to witness local commerce and buy authentic souvenirs yourself. Remember that
                            price is always
                            negotiableâ€¦ Get your haggle on!
                            <br> <br>
                            Near the Gold Souk in Dubai, you'll also find a great little museum, the Dubai Museum. It's located
                            inside Al Fahidi
                            Fort, which was built in the late 18th century as a defensive position for the ruling monarchy.
                            <br> <br>
                            Spend an hour walking through the museum, learning about the early civilisations that lived in the
                            Arabian Desert. When
                            you're finished, make sure to stop off at the Arabian Tea House nearby.

                            Henna Painting at The Abu Dhabi Heritage Village
                        </h4> <br> <br>
                        <p>
                            A great place to see henna artists performing their trade (and maybe try it for yourself) is at the
                            Abu Dhabi Heritage
                            Village.
                            <br> <br>
                            Henna is a type of dye used to stain the skin. In Islam, tattoos are prohibited, so henna painting
                            emerged as a
                            tradition in Arabic countries.
                            <br> <br>
                            Henna painting has been practiced for centuries and has important ceremonial value, often being
                            incorporated into
                            weddings for good luck. Henna also has cooling properties, which makes it even more popular in
                            desert climates.
